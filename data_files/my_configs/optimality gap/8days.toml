# Scenario Name (Mandatory)
# This scenario name is used to label results within the output .sqlite file
scenario = "zulu"

# Scenaio Mode (Mandatory)
# See documentation for explanations.  A standard single run is "perfect_foresight"
# mode must be one of (case-insensitive):

# Output file (Mandatory)

# For Pefrect Foresight, the user may target the same input file or a separate /
# copied sqlite file in a different location.  Myopic requires that input_database = output_database

#        DATA / MODEL CHECKS
#  To check data / cost integrity
# ------------------------------------

# Check the pricing structure for common errors, which are reported in the log file
# Strongly recommended

# Check the network connectivity for processes in the model.  Strongly
# recommended to ensure proper performance.  Results are reported in log file
# This requires that source commodities be marked with 's' in Commodity table
# This is required for Myopic runs

# Produce HTML files for Commodity Networks.  Requires source_trace above

#             SOLVER
#        Solver Selection
# ------------------------------------

# use the NEOS server to solve.  (Currently NOT supported)

# solver (Mandatory)
# Depending on what client machine has installed.
#  [cbc, appsi_highs, gurobi, cplex, ...]
