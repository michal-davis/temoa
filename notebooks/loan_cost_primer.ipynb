    "## Loan Costing Discussion\n",
    "This example uses the cost formulae from the `temoa_rules.py` file in order to verify costs used for loan.  The Temoa dox for the loan cost explain the original formula fairly well.  The original pointer to the formula is from Kevin Hunter et. all paper in ~2013.  See equation (15) on the included document and description.  Of particular note, that document uses the loan lifetime in a few spots, and somewhere along the way the tech lifetime crept into the formula in the form of the `lifetime_process` variable, which seems like a mistake\n",

    "### Key Questions:\n",
    "1. What is `discount_rate`?  It looks and smells like the loan rate.  The dox are just wrong.\n",
    "2. Is the inclusion of the process lifetime in the loan cost calculation a typo?  Seems it should be loan life across the board\n",
    "3. Is the approach to undiscounted correct?\n",
    "4. It is unclear what the plan is for \"hurdle rate\" -- and if any support from me is needed on that\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ponderings...\n",
    "- Note that in none of these approaches renders the \"full cost\" of a scenario visible because of the eclipsing effect of the end of the window in perfect foresight or the end of the shorter myopic windows.\n",
    "- A corollary of that (that I stumbled into the other day during testing) is that it is impossible to compare costs when using different myopic view depths.  More clearly:  When I changed from a view depth of 1 to 2 (seeing further into the future), I expected cost to go down--as they should--but they went up, which is attributable to having more of the loan lives visible to the calculation.  This may/may not be important to the team.  It is just an observation.\n",
    "- It wouldn't be too much work to enable a 3rd mode for these to calculate the \"full cost\" by making the windowing feature conditional on some flag."
