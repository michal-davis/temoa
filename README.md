# Getting Started with TEMOA and Version 3

## Overview

The main subdirectories in the project are:

1. `temoa/`
Contains the core Temoa model
2. `temoa/temoa_model`
The core model code necessary to build and solve a Temoa instance
3. `temoa/data_processing`
Code for post-processing solved models and working with output
4. `temoa/extensions`
Model extensions to solve the model using differing techniques.  Note:  There is some legacy and non-working
code in these modules that is planned future work.

5. `data_files/`
Intended to hold input data files and config files.  Examples are included.
Note that the example file utopia.sql represents a simple system called 'Utopia', which
is packaged with the MARKAL model generator and has been used
extensively for benchmarking exercises.
6. `output_files/`
The target for run-generated output including log files and other requested products.  Temoa will create
time-stamped folders to gather output for runs
4. `docs/`
Contains the source code for the Temoa project manual, in reStructuredText
(ReST) format.
5. `notebooks/`
jupyter notebooks associated with the project.  Note:  Not all of these are functional at this time, but are
retained to guide future development

## Guide to Setup

1. Obtain a current copy of Python from the python.org website.  The model has been tested with 3.11 and 3.12.  It will
fail (raise error) on earlier versions.
2. A `requirements.txt` file has been included to allow for use of `pip` to populate a virtual environment.  In order to use that the steps are:
- Ensure you have a copy of python 3.11/3.12 installed on your machine ([python.org]())
- Make and activate a virtual environment using the `venv` package:

```
$ python3.11 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate   # for linux/osx, windows activation command may differ
```
- Verify that you have a prepended indicator on your cursor that you are in the virtual environment (see below)
- After activating the venv, use `pip` *within* the venv to install everything.  Most IDEs have automated tools to
help set up and associate this venv with the project.  It is also possible from the command line:
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- For Conda users, an environment.yml file is provided that is not currently fully tested.  Additional installs may 
be required.
3. The entry point for regular execution is now at the top level of the project so a "sample" run should be initiated as:

```
(venv) temoa $ python main.py --config data_files/my_configs/config_sample.toml
```

## Database Setup
- Several sample database files in Version 3 format are provided in SQL format for learning/testing.  These are provided in the 
`data_files/example_dbs` folder.  In order to use them, they must be converted into sqlite database files.  This can 
be done from the command line using the sqlite3 engine to convert them.  sqlite3 is packaged with Python and should be
available.  If not, most configuration managers should be able to install it.  The command to make the `.sqlite` file
is (for Utopia as an example):
```
(venv) $ sqlite3 utopia.sqlite < utopia.sql
```
- Converting legacy db's to Version 3 can be done with the included database migration tool.  Users who use this
tool are advised to carefully review the console outputs during conversion to ensure accuracy and check the 
converted database carefully.  The migration tool will build an empty new Version 3 database and move data from
the old database, preserving the legacy database in place.  The command can be run from the top level of the 
project and needs pointers to the target database and the Version 3 schema file.  A typical execution from top level
should look like:

```
(venv) $ python temoa/utilities/db_migration_to_v3.py --source data_files/<legacy db>.sqlite  --schema data_files/temoa_schema_v3.sql
```
- Users may also create a blank full or minimal version of the database from the two schema files in the `data_files`
directory as described above using the `sqlite3` command.  The "minimal" version excludes some of the group
parameters and is recommended as a starting point for entry-level models.  It can be upgraded to the full set of
tables by executing the full schema SQL command on the resulting database later, which will add the missing tables.

## Config Files

- A configuration (config) file is required to run the model.  The `sample_config.toml` is provided as a reference
and has all parameters in it.  It can be copied/renamed, etc.
- Notes on Config Options:

Field | Notes
---|---
Scenario Name | A name used in output tables for results
Temoa Mode | The execution mode.  See note below on currently supported modes
Input/Output DB | The source (and optionally diffent) output database.  Note for myopic input must be same as output
Price Checking | Run the "price checker" on the built model to look for costing deficiencies and log them
Source Tracing | Check the integrity of the commodity flow network in every region-period combination.  Required for Myopic
Commodity Graphs | Produce HTML (viewable in any browser) displays of the networks built
Solver | The exact name of the solver executable to call within `pyomo`
Save Excel | Save core output data to excel files.  Needed if user intends to use the graphviz post-processing modules
Save LP | Save the created LP model files
Myopic Settings | The view depth (periods to solve per iteration) and step (periods to step between iterations)

## Currently Supported Modes
### Check
Build the model and run the numerous checks on it.  Results will be in the log file.  No solve is attempted.
### Perfect Foresight
All-in-one run that solves the entire model at once.  It is possible to run this without source tracing, which will
use raw data in the model without checking the integrity of the underlying network.  It is highly advised to use
source tracing for most accurate results.
### Myopic
Solve the model sequentially through iterative solves based on Myopic settings.  Source tracing is required to
accomodate build/no-build decisions made per iteration to ensure follow-on models are well built.
### Build Only
Mostly for test/troubleshooting.  This builds/returns an un-solved model

Several other options are possible to pass to the main execution command including changing the logging level to
`debug` or running silent (no console feedback) which may be best for server runs.  Also, redirecting the output
products is possible.  To see available options invoke the `main.py` file with the `-h` flag:

```
(venv) $ python main.py -h
```

## Typical Run
1. Prepare a database (or copy of one) as described above.  Runs will fill the output tables and overwrite any data with the 
same scenario name.
2. Perepare a config file with paths to the database(s) relative to the top of the project, as in the example
3. Run the model, using the `main.py` entry point from the top-level of the project:
```
(venv) temoa $ python main.py --config data_files/my_configs/config_sample.toml
```
4. Review the config display and accept
5. Review the log file and output products which are automatically placed in a time-stamped folder in `output_files`, 
unless user has redirected output
6. Review the data in the Output tables

## Testing
Users who wish to exercise the `pytest` based test in the test folder can do so from the command line or any IDE.
Note that many of the tests perform solves on small models using the freely available `cbc` solver, which is
required to run the testing suite.

The tests should all run and pass (several are currently skipped and reflect in-process work).  Tests should normally
be run from the top level of the `tests folder`.  If `pytest` is installed it will locate tests within the folder and
run/report them.  Note the dot '.' below indicating current folder:

```
(venv) temoa/tests pytest .
```
Several of the packages used may currently generate warnings during this testing process, but the tests should all PASS
with the exception of skipped tests.
